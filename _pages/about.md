Hi there, I'm Xinyu! 👋

I’m currently a Ph.D. student jointly trained at **Indiana University Bloomington** and **IU Indianapolis**, exploring the intersection of **sensor science**, **signal processing**, **quantum computing**, and **deep learning**.  

I see research as a journey driven by curiosity and creativity. What excites me most is discovering new ideas and transforming them into practical, meaningful technologies.

🌱 Current Research Interests
- Intelligent sensing systems  
- Signal processing and computational modeling  
- Deep learning for physical systems  
- Quantum computing and hybrid ML–quantum frameworks  

🎯 Long-Term Vision
To bridge the physical and computational worlds by developing sensing and learning frameworks that are innovative, reliable, and impactful in real-world environments.

🤝 Let’s Connect!
I truly enjoy meeting people who share similar interests.  
If you’re working in related areas—or simply curious about these topics—  
**feel free to reach out anytime. I’d love to exchange ideas and collaborate.**
